# JDA (Java Discord API)

JDA strives to provide a clean and full wrapping of the Discord REST api and its Websocket-Events for Java.
> Note: If you have any suggestions/questions/feedback for this wiki please contact Minn#6688 or DV8FromTheWorld#6297 via [Discord](https://discord.gg/0hMr4ce0tIk3pSjp)

## Examples:
```java
public class ReadyListener implements EventListener
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    throws LoginException
    {
        JDA jda = JDABuilder.createDefault(args[0])
            .addEventListeners(new ReadyListener()).build();
    }

    @Override
    public void onEvent(GenericEvent event)
    {
        if(event instanceof ReadyEvent)
            System.out.println("API is ready!");
    }
}
```

```java
public class MessageListener extends ListenerAdapter
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    throws LoginException
    {
        JDA jda = JDABuilder.createDefault(args[0]).build();
        jda.addEventListeners(new MessageListener());
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(MessageReceivedEvent event)
    {
        if (event.isFromType(ChannelType.TEXT))
        {
            System.out.printf("[%s][%s] %#s: %s%n", event.getGuild().getName(),
                event.getChannel().getName(), event.getAuthor(), event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.printf("[PM] %#s: %s%n", event.getAuthor(), event.getMessage().getContentDisplay());
        }
    }
}
```

## More Examples
We provide a small set of Examples in the [Example Directory](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/tree/master/src/examples/java).

## Download
You can get the latest released builds here:
[Promoted Downloads](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases)

If you want the most up-to-date builds, you can get them here: [Latest Build Downloads](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/)

## Docs
Javadocs are available in both jar format and web format.<br>
The jar format is available on the [Promoted Downloads](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/releases) page or on any of the
build pages of the [Downloads](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/).<br>
<br>
The web format allows for viewing of the [Latest Docs](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/javadoc/)
and also viewing of each individual build's javadoc. To view the javadoc for a specific build, you will need to go to that build's page
on [the build server](https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/) and download the javadoc jar for the specific build.<br>
A shortcut would be: https://ci.dv8tion.net/job/JDA/BUILD_NUMBER_GOES_HERE, you just need to replace the 
"BUILD_NUMBER_GOES_HERE" with the build you want.<br>
Once you have the jar extract the files with the zip tool of your preference (winrar or 7zip, etc.) and open the `index.html` file with your internet browser.

## Getting Help
If you need help, or just want to talk with the JDA or other Devs, you can join the [Official JDA Discord Guild](https://discord.gg/0hMr4ce0tIl3SLv5).

Alternatively you can also join the [Unofficial Discord API Guild](https://discord.gg/discord-api).
Once you joined, you can find JDA-specific help in the `#java_jda` channel.

For guides and setup help you can also take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/wiki)
<br>Especially interesting are the [Getting Started](../using_jda/Getting_Started.md)
and [Setup](../setup/Setup.md) Pages.

## Contributing to JDA
If you want to contribute to JDA, make sure to base your branch off of our **development** branch (or a feature-branch)
and create your PR into that **same** branch. **We will be rejecting any PRs between branches or into release branches!**

It is also highly recommended to get in touch with the Devs before opening Pull Requests (either through an issue or the Discord servers mentioned above).<br>
It is very possible that your change might already be in development or you missed something.
